# Practice-of-Classification-models-on-TIP-data
The main goal of this project is using fossils description to identify unknown species. In another word, employ classification methods to classify new species to its family. Specifically, treatise on invertebrate palaeontology (TIP) will be used to train two certain classification models (Decision Tree and Random Forest), and then a bunch of description samples extracted from internet about some unknown organisms will be used to test the models. Evaluation, comparison and report are included in this project as well. As our results, Decision Tree classifier performs better than Random Forest classifier on this dataset. Its highest accuracy could reach 0.536.
